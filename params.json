{"body":"# Data Structures For Game Developers (ds)\r\nFormerly known as \"_AS3 Data Structures For Game Developers (AS3DS)_\", the package contains parametrized classes that allow programmers to easily implement standard data structures like linked lists, queues, stacks or multi-dimensional arrays. The result is somewhere in between the C++ STL (Standard Template Library) and the Java Collection framework. The library is highly optimized and uses advanced Haxe features like inlining or code generation for parametrized classes through the haxe.rtti.Generics interface.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nInstall [Haxe](http://haxe.org/download) and run `$ haxelib install polygonal-ds` from the console.\r\nThis installs the polygonal-ds library hosted on [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org/p/polygonal-ds), which always mirrors the git master branch. From now on just compile with `$ haxe ... -lib polygonal-ds`.\r\nIf you want to test the latest beta build, you should pull the dev branch and add the src folder to the classpath via `$ haxe ... -cp src`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n-    Slides [Introduction to ds - Data Structures For Games](http://lab.polygonal.de/wp-content/assets/120111/introduction_to_ds.pdf)\r\n-    API [http://polygonal.github.com/doc/ds/](http://polygonal.github.com/doc/ds/)\r\n\r\n## Articles\r\n\r\n-    [A* Pathfinding](http://lab.polygonal.de/?p=1815)\r\n-    [Heaps and Priority Queues](http://lab.polygonal.de/?p=1710)\r\n-    [What is a Deque?](http://lab.polygonal.de/?p=1472)\r\n-    [Fast hash tables](http://lab.polygonal.de/?p=1325)\r\n-    [Alchemy Memory Management](http://lab.polygonal.de/?p=1230)\r\n\r\n## Cross-Platform Support\r\n\r\nds currently supports Flash AVM1+2, JavaScript, C++ and Neko\r\n\r\n## Conditional Compilation Flags\r\n`-D generic`\r\n\r\nEnables generic classes (implements haxe.rtti.Generic). Optimization for strictly typed runtimes (AVM2), but increases file size.\r\n\r\n`-D alchemy`\r\n\r\nEnables fast virtual memory for FP10+ (\"alchemy memory\"). By default, memory access is replaced with arrays or the flash Vector class.\r\n\r\n`-D doc`\r\n\r\nPrevents less important inner classes from being documented.\r\n\r\n## Questions, Comments, Feature Requests...\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/polygonal-ds","note":"Don't delete this file!
